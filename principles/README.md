# Principles

When we know our principles, our decisions are easy. Our actions are motivated by the principles that unite and guide us. This is what HOT_Tech is built on.

1. Cultivate our collective // To go fast go alone, to go far, go together. 
Our first principle is our first priority.  We are collaborative at our core. We apply self-regulation and welcome open contribution, review and feedback. Our contributions enrich the ecosystem and contribute to common goals.

2. Respect our resources // A society grows when people plant trees whose shade under which they will never sit. 
We never take what we have for granted. We are lean in principle and practice. We work to collect resources when they are available and use them in times of need. We value and use resources and services that can be renewed and reused. We aim to obtain a yield that can be reinvested in our future. We ensure energy invested is energy returned. Think tomorrow, act today, sustainability for seven generations.

3. Include with intention // If we don’t intentionally include, we will unintentionally exclude. 
Inclusion begins with intention. We acknowledge that something can be normal, without being average. We use and value the edges and the marginal, because we believe the edge is where the action is. Greater voices create greater harmonies. Through diversity comes resilience. 

4. Experiment to evolve // Follow the evidence wherever it leads
We evolve through experimentation, empiricism and evidence. We build, measure, learn and grow. Data drives our decision making. We value reason, logic and rationale, particularly when practiced in discussion and debate. 

5. Interoperable Autonomy // The art of working independently, together
We value independence, initiative and ingenuity. We celebrate makers, tinkerers and hacktivists. We integrate rather than segregate. We want our ecosystem to embrace and incubate ideas and share success and learning of the few to the many. 

6. Design for delight // An instrument is only musical to someone who can play it
We start with a problem and design for people. We design from patterns to details. We design experiences that engage and excite.  We want new users to become old friends.

7. agile by heart // respond to things as they are, not as they might be.
We can’t predict the future, but we can contribute to it. We observe and interact. We embrace and creatively respond to change. We are not afraid to fail, learn and adjust in order to adapt. We conscientiously and continuously evolve our products and our people.

8. Solve small and simple // A journey of a thousand miles, begins with a single step
We seek sophistication in simplicity. We want to try and know, before we grow. We believe we should start where we are, do what we can, with what we have. We believe only simple and sustainable solutions are scalable.

9. Data depth // Behind every piece of data is a story
We want to use our data to share untold stories. We make the vulnerable visible and amplify their voice. We want our data to be as deep as it is broad. We want our data to be open, accessible and engaging. We want our data to inspire and support action.
